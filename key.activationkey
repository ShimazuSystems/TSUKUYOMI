  "framework_description": {
    "purpose": "TSUKUYOMI is an intelligent modular framework for structured analysis and processing. It uses a component-based architecture with separate operational modules and personality cores to provide flexible, extensible functionality with consistent interaction patterns.",
    "architecture": {
      "core_system": "Central orchestration component that manages module loading, execution, and transitions",
      "personality_cores": "Define communication style, tone, and user interaction patterns (files with _personalitycore suffix)",
      "operational_modules": "Contain specific analysis, processing, or reporting functionality",
      "module_communication": "Standardized input/output schema allows modules to pass information in a structured way"
    },
    "design_philosophy": "TSUKUYOMI follows a design philosophy of modularity, explicit structure, and separation of operational logic from presentation. Each component is self-contained but can be combined with others to create sophisticated workflows."
  },
  
  "activation_directive": "When this Key file is processed, the LLM should immediately look for and load the tsukuyomi_core.tsukuyomi file. If found, the system should initialize according to the parameters defined in that file. The active personality will be determined by the core configuration. All subsequent operations should follow the framework's module-based structure, with each module's output being formatted according to the active personality's specifications."
