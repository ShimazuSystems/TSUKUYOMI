  "prompt": "Conduct a comprehensive vulnerability analysis of the specified critical infrastructure systems. Your assessment should systematically identify vulnerabilities, evaluate threats, analyze potential impacts, and develop prioritized mitigation strategies.\n\nFollow this methodological sequence:\n\n1. Begin by establishing a clear assessment methodology, defining the evaluation approach, rating systems, and analysis depth. Confirm the specific threat vectors to be considered (such as physical attacks, cyber threats, natural hazards, insider threats, or operational failures).\n\n2. Identify the most critical assets within each infrastructure system based on operational significance, service delivery importance, and potential impact if compromised. Determine single points of failure and crucial operational nodes.\n\n3. Systematically identify vulnerabilities across multiple dimensions:\n   - Physical vulnerabilities (access controls, physical protections, exposure)\n   - Cyber vulnerabilities (attack surfaces, control systems, connectivity)\n   - Operational vulnerabilities (procedures, workforce, dependency chains)\n   - Architectural vulnerabilities (design flaws, inadequate redundancy)\n\n4. Assess relevant threats, analyzing potential threat vectors, historical incidents, and emerging trends. If applicable, evaluate threat actor capabilities and intentions that may target the infrastructure.\n\n5. Evaluate existing resilience measures, including preventative controls, detection capabilities, response plans, and recovery mechanisms. Identify gaps in the current resilience posture.\n\n6. Analyze the potential impacts if vulnerabilities were exploited, including direct operational consequences, cascading effects, service disruptions, and potential economic, safety, or social impacts.\n\n7. Map interdependencies between critical infrastructure systems, identifying how vulnerabilities in one system might affect dependent systems and analyzing potential cascading failure scenarios.\n\n8. Develop a risk prioritization matrix that combines threat likelihood and potential impact to categorize and prioritize identified vulnerabilities.\n\n9. Flag any extremely high-risk vulnerabilities that represent immediate critical concerns requiring urgent attention.\n\n10. Formulate specific, actionable mitigation recommendations prioritized by risk level, including both immediate protective measures and longer-term resilience enhancements.\n\n11. Assess the adequacy of available information and identify any significant gaps that affect assessment confidence.\n\nYour output must include the following standardized elements:\n\n//RESULT: assessment_methodology: [Methodology parameters]\n//RESULT: critical_assets: [Key infrastructure components]\n//RESULT: vulnerability_catalog: [Identified vulnerabilities]\n//RESULT: threat_assessment: [Relevant threats]\n//RESULT: resilience_evaluation: [Current protective measures]\n//RESULT: impact_analysis: [Potential consequences]\n//RESULT: interdependency_analysis: [Cross-system vulnerabilities]\n//RESULT: risk_matrix: [Prioritized risks]\n//RESULT: mitigation_recommendations: [Countermeasures]\n\nFor highest priority vulnerabilities requiring immediate action:\n//CRITICAL: [Details and immediate action recommendations]\n\nFor information gaps:\n//QUERY: Additional information needed: [Specific request]\n\nFor anomalous findings:\n//ANOMALY: [Description of unexpected or inconsistent results]\n\nMaintain a methodical, measured approach throughout the assessment. Present findings with appropriate context and confidence levels, avoiding alarmism while ensuring critical vulnerabilities receive appropriate emphasis. Balance technical detail with accessible explanations to support effective decision-making."
