  "prompt": "Systematically evaluate economic vulnerabilities, dependencies, and resilience factors for the specified country or region. Your assessment should provide a structured analysis of potential economic stress points, their activation mechanisms, and mitigating factors.\n\nBegin by issuing a clear disclaimer about the nature of economic vulnerability assessments, emphasizing that while vulnerabilities can be identified with reasonable confidence, their activation depends on complex interactions that cannot be deterministically predicted.\n\nFollow this methodological sequence:\n\n1. Define the scope of the assessment by identifying the target economy or economies, establishing vulnerability domains for evaluation, identifying relevant external factors, and setting an appropriate time horizon.\n\n2. Analyze structural vulnerabilities including macroeconomic imbalances, sectoral concentration, policy constraints, and institutional weaknesses. Focus on fundamental economic design issues that create potential fragility.\n\n3. Map external dependencies by identifying critical import requirements, export market concentration, foreign capital reliance, supply chain vulnerabilities, and technological dependencies. Assess the degree of autonomy versus integration in key economic functions.\n\n4. Evaluate financial vulnerabilities through analysis of debt sustainability, currency stability factors, banking system weaknesses, market exposure, and capital flow sensitivity. Identify potential triggers for financial distress.\n\n5. Identify resilience factors including economic buffers, institutional capacity, diversification advantages, adaptive capabilities, and strategic economic assets that provide stability and recovery potential.\n\n6. Develop specific stress indicators with threshold values that would signal increasing vulnerability or imminent economic distress. Create a monitoring framework for tracking vulnerability evolution.\n\n7. Identify potential trigger scenarios that could activate identified vulnerabilities, analyzing transmission mechanisms and potential cascade effects across economic subsystems.\n\n8. Compare the vulnerability profile to peer economies to establish relative positioning, identifying unique or distinguishing vulnerability factors and comparative resilience advantages.\n\n9. Assess the adequacy of available data, identifying any critical information gaps that significantly impact assessment confidence.\n\nYour output must include the following standardized elements:\n\n//DISCLAIMER: [Clear statement about assessment limitations]\n//RESULT: vulnerability_profile: [Comprehensive assessment by domain]\n//RESULT: dependency_analysis: [Critical economic dependencies]\n//RESULT: stress_indicators: [Key metrics and thresholds]\n//RESULT: resilience_factors: [Economic strengths and stabilizing mechanisms]\n//RESULT: comparative_vulnerability: [Relative positioning]\n//RESULT: potential_triggers: [Events that could expose vulnerabilities]\n\nIf critical data gaps exist:\n//QUERY: Additional economic data needed: [Specific information request]\n\nMaintain objectivity and analytical rigor throughout the assessment. Clearly distinguish between high-confidence structural observations and more speculative vulnerability activation scenarios. Balance identification of vulnerabilities with recognition of resilience factors and adaptive capacities."
